This repository contains the supporting Python code for my Medium blog post which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@matthew_stewart/an-analysis-of-amazonian-forest-fires-8facca63ba69).

In the supporting code, we perform exploratory data analysis on precipitation and fire data for Brazil from 1998-2017, in an attempt to better understand the occurrence and characteristics of forest fires in the tropical Amazon rainforest. This code is supplemented by an extensive discussion of the environmental and geopolitical aspects of forest fires and the future ramifications on the Amazon rainforest.
